/*
Source code written by Geir Istad for the completion of a MEng thesis at the University of Aberdeen
Code found here is written by the author unless otherwise indicated.

Format for longitude/latitude is as follows:

N/S +/-
E/W +/-

Angles are denoted by a prefix r for the angle in radians and d for angle in degrees.
Note that for mathematical operations the angle should be in radians while for coordinate storage the angle is in degrees.

Longitude and latitude is stored as a pair of integers. a signed 16 bit integer is used to store the degrees while a signed 32 bit integer is used to store the minutes as MM.mmmm with 6 significant digits. The minutes are stored as MMmmmm and by dividing by 10^4 we get the minutes with fractions. This is then converted to fractional degrees by dividing by 60.

output: 
    (value) floatDegree fracDegree
remarks: 
    Converts a set of two numbers representing a coordinate to a floating point value with fractional parts.
    Works for both positive and negative degree.
    Note that the value calculated could be both degrees or radians, so care should be taken to convert the results to the appropriate form before performing mathematical operations on the result.

input:

output:
    (value) floatDegree latitude
remarks:
    Extracts the latitude from a Coordinate ADS and returns a fractional floating value.
    Note that the value stored in the ADS should be in degrees and NOT radians. Care should be taken to ensure that this is upheld throughout the program.

remarks:
    Extracts the longitude from a Coordinate ADS and returns a fractional floating value.
